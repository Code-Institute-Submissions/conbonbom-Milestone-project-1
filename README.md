# Milestone-project-1
## Gym Website
This project was to create a website for a gym that would attract new members and help retain exsisting members.
I have decided to make a website for an imaginary gym called "Dublin Fitness".

## Potential visitors
* Members: These visitors main reason to visit the website will be to check class timetables and book a class.
It would also be helpful to remind them of the facilities on offer.

* Potential Members:These visitors to the website need to be shown photos of the gym in action in order to encourage them to join. 
 They will also need to be shown that the gym has a free one week trial and they will also benifit from testimonials from exisiting gym members

## User experience
I would like to keep the website as clear and easy to navigate as possible so ive kept the website to three pages.
a homepage, a 'join up' page  and a 'members' page.

**Across all pages:**
In order to keep the pages cohesive i would like to make a header with links to each page(Home,Join up, Members)
Each link will have a icon attached with a transition on hover to attract the users eye.
The Footer will also be the same across all pages. this will contain the gyms address, opening hours and contact details including links to social media.
These links will also have a transition on hover to catch the eye.

**Homepage:**
The main focus of the homepage will be an image carousel In order to attract potential customers and remind existing members of whats on offer
I hope to do an image carousel of three dynamic images of the gym with some short snappy text at the bottom of each slide

**Join up page:**
This will be the page that potential members of the gym will join. In order to keep the information clear and concise there will be two sections only.
One will have testimonials from existing members to further encourage the visitor to join. 
The other will have a short paragraph about the gym. in the paragraph the potential member will be alerted to to the one weeks trial on offer 
and the paragraph will be followed by a 'Join up!' button.

**Members Page:**
This will be the page that existing members will visit. Again this page will be seperated into two sections.
In one section will be have a paragraph with information about the classes 
and in the other section we will have a timetable of classes followed by a button to sign in and book a class. 
This will hopefully keep the information clear and easy to use and keep exisiting members coming back to book classes online.

**wireframes:** Availabe here [Link](/assets/images/wireframes)

## Testing/bugs

I have tried my best to keep the website as responsive as possible however i feel there is many improvements to be made here.
There is also an issue with one of the images in the carousel. I think the resolution makes it not very suitable for use here.
The website was tested on:
* google chrome
* safari
* internet explorer
* iphone 6
* iphone X
* samsung galaxy 10

## Future

In the future i would like to fix how the website works for mobile in particular the timetable section. 
I would also like to take a look at th the pop up modals. I feel they would benefit from some extra styling

## Deployment
The web page was deployed using git hub pages. In the settings section of the repositry on git hub i went o git hub pages. And deployed from there

The website is available to view here: [link](https://conbonbom.github.io/Milestone-project-1/)
